# GAC
Code to implement Generalized Assorted Cameras (see jrholloway.com/Projects/GAC)

Implementing GAC requires many steps, which I have split up into three parts:
1) Calibration
2) Depth Estimation and Warping
3) Image fusion

C++ code is provided for each of these tasks for RGBY and RGBY+NIR imaging. The hyperspectral fusion/recovery code will be provided as MATLAB code once it is cleaned up.

The codes in this repository rely on OpenCV (2.4.x or 3.0.x) and the graph cuts implementation from Veksler and Delong (http://vision.csd.uwo.ca/code/). 

Windows users: Building OpenCV is not required to use this code. Everything should run if you install OpenCV from the executable.

The three steps for the GAC implementation are intended to be independet programs to help keep data input to a minimum for a single program call, as well as to minimize redundant computation if you decide to tweak a parameter. Source code for each of the steps is kept in a separate folder in the repository.

Data from the paper is available from my website jrholloway.com/Projects/GAC
